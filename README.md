# Euler12_Python

Problem 12 of Project Euler solved in Python 3 using PyCharm. This solution uses the closed-form formula for computing triangle numbers: 

T(n) = n*(n+1) / 2

The solution also uses a property of prime factors to determine the number of proper divisors any particular number has (see Links and References) 

## Project Euler Problem 12 -- Highly Divisible Triangular Number

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

**&nbsp;1:** 1<br/>
**&nbsp;3:** 1,3<br/>
**&nbsp;6:** 1,2,3,6<br/>
**10:** 1,2,5,10<br/>
**15:** 1,3,5,15<br/>
**21:** 1,3,7,21<br/>
**28:** 1,2,4,7,14,28


We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
